# hwylterm todo's

- [x] add cligen adapters to add colors with bbansi
  - [ ] add integration test check cligen
  - [ ] test cligen generator with recent releases (use example from cligen repo?)
- [x] add generic help generator to accompany parseopt

## improvements

- [ ] addJoinStyle(); works like join except wraps each argument in a style first
- [-] revamp spinner api (new threads module?)
- [x] add Bbstring ~~indexing operations~~ strutils, that are span aware

## cli generator

- [x] add InferShortFlags setting
- [x] add support for types(metavars)/defaults/required in help output
- [x] BUG: flag can't be `key`
- [ ] ShowHelp setting should also occur after "a hwylCliError"
      could be by default (see `program --help` for more info.)
- [ ] consider support "more verbose" help i.e. -h vs --help giving different results (behind a setting LongHelp, would only change the render proc used)
- [x] add support for E/env param for flags to add custom env_var (in help (env: OPTIONAL_ENV_VAR))
- [ ] consider default (or opt in) "help subcmd"
  > app help (show all help?)
  > app help <subcmd> same as app <subcmd> --help
- [ ] allow single positional to be optional
- [x] support flag grouping in help output:
    flags:
      -a some flag
